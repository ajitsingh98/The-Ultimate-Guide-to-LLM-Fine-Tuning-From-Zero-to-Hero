## 🔥 Introduction

Fine-tuning LLMs allows us to adapt pre-trained models to specific domains, tasks, or instruction styles. This repository provides an end-to-end guide covering:
- The differences between full fine-tuning, instruction tuning, and PEFT
- Real-world use cases and challenges
- Cost-efficient strategies for deployment

## 🛠 Fine-Tuning Techniques

### **1️⃣ Standard Fine-Tuning**
- Full model adaptation for domain-specific tasks
- Requires significant compute resources

### **2️⃣ Instruction Tuning**
- Fine-tuning LLMs to follow human instructions better
- Examples: FLAN-T5, Alpaca, Mistral-Instruct

### **3️⃣ Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**
- Techniques: LoRA, QLoRA, Adapters, BitFit
- Reduces computational cost while maintaining performance

## 📂 Dataset Preparation
- Collecting and formatting data
- Tokenization and preprocessing
- Creating instruction datasets for instruction tuning

## 🚀 Training Strategies
- Supervised fine-tuning vs. self-supervised learning
- Mixed precision training (FP16/BF16)
- Distributed training with DeepSpeed and FSDP

## ⚡ Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA & QLoRA)
- Prefix tuning and adapters
- Fine-tuning large models on consumer GPUs

## 📊 Evaluation & Metrics
- BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR for text generation
- Perplexity and loss monitoring
- Human preference evaluation (MT-Bench, HELM)

## 💻 Hands-On Implementation
- Fine-tuning GPT models using Hugging Face Transformers
- Implementing LoRA and QLoRA with PyTorch
- Deploying fine-tuned models with FastAPI
